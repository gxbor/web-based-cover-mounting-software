**Web-Based PDF Cover Mounting Tool**

Developed a browser-based application to automate and streamline the preparation of book covers for print production. The system calculates precise cover layouts based on spine width, bleed, and trim specifications, then accurately mounts provided PDFs or images onto the generated templates for error-free print alignment.

Key Features & Contributions:

Layout Calculation Engine: Automatically computes spine width and panel sizes from input dimensions and material specs.

Accurate Mounting & Positioning: Places artwork on the calculated template with pixel-perfect alignment, ensuring compliance with print-ready standards.

Authentication & User Management: Implemented secure sign-up/sign-in flows and role-based access to protect project files.

File Storage & Retrieval: Integrated persistent storage for uploaded PDFs/images and generated layouts, with version tracking.

Real-Time Preview: Enabled instant visualization of mounted covers in-browser before export.

Export Options: Generated print-ready PDF output meeting industry prepress requirements.

Impact:
Reduced manual layout errors, improved turnaround time for cover preparation, and provided a scalable solution usable from any device without installing desktop software.
